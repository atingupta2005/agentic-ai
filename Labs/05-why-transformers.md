# üöÄ Why Transformers?  
## Evolution from RNNs to LSTMs to Transformers  

## Introduction  
Natural language, time series, and even music all have ‚Äúmemory.‚Äù Early neural networks treated each input independently. As we sought to model sequences‚Äîsentences, stock prices, DNA‚Äîarchitectures evolved to remember and process context. In this section, we trace that evolution: from RNNs to LSTMs to the revolutionary Transformer.  

---

## 1. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)  

### 1.1 Architecture Overview  
- RNNs introduce **cycles** in the neural graph, allowing information to persist across time steps.  
- A single RNN cell takes an input vector **x‚Çú** and a hidden state **h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ**, produces an output **y‚Çú** and new hidden state **h‚Çú**.  

```text
  h‚Çú = f(W‚Çï‚Çï ¬∑ h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ + W‚Çì‚Çï ¬∑ x‚Çú + b‚Çï)
  y‚Çú = g(W‚Çïy ¬∑ h‚Çú + b_y)
```

- Here, **f** is usually tanh or ReLU; **g** might be softmax for classification.

### 1.2 Strengths and Use Cases  
- Captures short-term dependencies in sequences.  
- Well-suited for:
  - Language modelling (next-word prediction)  
  - Simple time-series forecasting  
  - Sequence tagging (POS, NER)  

### 1.3 Limitations: Vanishing & Exploding Gradients  
- **Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)** must pass gradients through many steps.  
- For long sequences:
  - Gradients can shrink exponentially ‚Üí **vanishing gradient**, learns little.  
  - Or explode ‚Üí **unstable training**, huge weight updates.  

> **Analogy:** Passing a secret message down a long line of people‚Äîsmall distortions accumulate until the end message makes no sense, or people shout so loudly it echoes uncontrollably.

---

## 2. Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)  

### 2.1 LSTM Cell Mechanics  
LSTM cells add a **cell state C‚Çú** alongside the hidden state h‚Çú, controlling information flow via gates.

```
Forget Gate      Input Gate       Output Gate
    ‚¨á               ‚¨á                ‚¨á
   ft = œÉ(Wf¬∑[h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ, x‚Çú] + bf)
   it = œÉ(Wi¬∑[h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ, x‚Çú] + bi)
   ot = œÉ(Wo¬∑[h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ, x‚Çú] + bo)

   CÃÉ‚Çú = tanh(WC¬∑[h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ, x‚Çú] + bC)
   C‚Çú = ft * C‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ + it * CÃÉ‚Çú
   h‚Çú = ot * tanh(C‚Çú)
```

### 2.2 Gates: Forget, Input, Output  
- **Forget gate (f‚Çú):** Decides which old information to discard.  
- **Input gate (i‚Çú):** Determines which new information to add.  
- **Output gate (o‚Çú):** Controls what to output from cell state.  

> **Tip:** Think of C‚Çú as a conveyor belt of memory, and the gates as valves controlling flow in and out.

### 2.3 How LSTMs Solve RNN Limitations  
- By allowing gradients to flow more unchanged via the cell state, LSTMs mitigate vanishing/exploding gradients.  
- They can learn **long-range** dependencies (hundreds of time steps).

### 2.4 Example: Text Generation with LSTM  
```python
# Pseudocode for a simple LSTM text generator
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(vocab_size, 128, input_length=seq_length))
model.add(LSTM(256, return_sequences=True))
model.add(LSTM(256))
model.add(Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax'))
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')
model.fit(X, y, epochs=50)
```
- Supply sequences of characters/words; the network learns to predict next character/word.  
- After training, seed the model with an initial text, sample from its probability distribution to generate novel text.

---

## 3. Why We Needed Something New  

### 3.1 Scaling to Longer Contexts  
- Even LSTMs struggle when the context needed spans thousands of words or very long time series.  

### 3.2 Parallelization Challenges  
- RNNs and LSTMs are inherently **sequential**: you cannot compute h‚Çú before h‚Çú‚Çã‚ÇÅ.  
- This limits training speed on modern hardware (GPUs/TPUs are optimized for parallel ops).

### 3.3 Attention as the Key Insight  
- Instead of processing step by step, **attention** lets every output position look at all inputs directly.  
- This bypasses the sequential bottleneck and captures long-range interactions in a single layer.

> **High-Level View:** If RNNs/LSTMs are reading a book line by line, attention lets you flip to any page instantly to find relevant information.

---

## 4. Birth of Transformers  

### 4.1 ‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù (Vaswani et al., 2017)  
- Introduced a model using **only attention mechanisms**, no recurrence or convolution.  
- Achieved state-of-the-art in machine translation with far greater parallelism.

### 4.2 Encoder‚ÄìDecoder Structure  
- **Encoder stack:** Processes the entire input sequence into a set of continuous representations.  
- **Decoder stack:** Generates output sequence autoregressively, attending to encoder outputs and previously generated tokens.

```text
Input Embedding ‚Üí [Encoder Layer]√óN ‚Üí Encoded Representations
              ‚Üì
          [Decoder Layer]√óM ‚Üí Output Embedding
              ‚Üì
          Linear + Softmax ‚Üí Predicted Tokens
```

### 4.3 Multi-Head Attention  
- Splits queries (Q), keys (K), values (V) into H heads.  
- Each head performs scaled dot-product attention in parallel, capturing different types of relationships.

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q¬∑K·µÄ / ‚àöd_k) ¬∑ V
MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, head_H)¬∑W·µí
```

### 4.4 Positional Encoding  
- Since transformers lack recurrence, they add **positional encodings** to input embeddings to inject sequence order.

```python
# Pseudocode: sinusoidal positional encoding
pos_enc[i, 2k]   = sin(i / (10000^(2k/d_model)))
pos_enc[i, 2k+1] = cos(i / (10000^(2k/d_model)))
```

---

## 5. Summary of Evolution  
- **RNNs** introduced sequence processing but hit gradient issues and slow training.  
- **LSTMs** solved many RNN pitfalls, enabling longer dependencies but remained sequentially bound.  
- **Transformers** removed recurrence, embraced attention fully, and unlocked massive parallelism and context length.

---

## 6. What Is Attention?  

At its core, **attention** is a mechanism that allows a model to focus on specific parts of its input when producing each element of its output. In language, that means looking at relevant words; in vision, looking at relevant patches of an image.

- Traditional sequence models compress an entire input into a fixed-size vector.
- Attention lets the model dynamically pick and choose which parts of the input matter most, **per output step**.

**Analogy:** Reading a book summary, you don‚Äôt memorize every sentence. You scan chapters for key phrases. Attention does this scanning automatically.

---

## 7. Motivation Behind Attention  

### 7.1 Overcoming Bottlenecks  
- RNNs/LSTMs must squeeze context into a single hidden state‚Äîleading to information loss.
- Attention creates **direct pathways** between any input and any output position.

### 7.2 Handling Long Sequences  
- Long-range dependencies (e.g., ‚ÄúThe dinosaur that the boy spotted‚Ä¶‚Äù require looking far back).
- Attention can connect token ‚Äúdinosaur‚Äù to ‚Äúspotted‚Äù even if they‚Äôre 50 words apart.

### 7.3 Parallelization  
- Unlike recurrence, attention computes relationships between all positions **simultaneously**, enabling efficient GPU/TPU utilization.

---

## 8. Scaled Dot-Product Attention  

Scaled dot-product attention is the primary building block of Transformer attention layers.

### 8.1 Queries, Keys, and Values  

| Component | Role                                                      |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Query (Q) | ‚ÄúWhat am I looking for?‚Äù                                  |
| Key   (K) | ‚ÄúWhat information do I have?‚Äù                             |
| Value (V) | ‚ÄúWhat data should I read if the key matches my query?‚Äù    |

Every input token is projected into three vectors: Q, K, and V.  

### 8.2 Computing Attention Scores  

1. **Dot Product**: Compute raw scores  
   \[ \text{score}_{ij} = Q_i \cdot K_j \]
2. **Scale**: Prevent large magnitudes  
   \[ \text{scaled}_{ij} = \frac{\text{score}_{ij}}{\sqrt{d_k}} \]
3. **Softmax**: Convert to probabilities  
   \[ \alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{scaled}_{ij})}{\sum_{j'} \exp(\text{scaled}_{ij'})} \]
4. **Weighted Sum**: Combine values  
   \[ \text{Attention}(Q, K, V)_i = \sum_{j} \alpha_{ij} V_j \]

```python
# Pseudocode for scaled dot-product attention
scores = Q @ K.T
scaled_scores = scores / sqrt(d_k)
weights = softmax(scaled_scores, axis=-1)
output = weights @ V
```

> **Tip:** Scaling by ‚àöd‚Çñ keeps gradients stable when d‚Çñ is large.

---

## 9. Multi-Head Attention  

Multi-head attention extends single-head by running **H** attention layers (heads) in parallel.

### 9.1 Why Multiple Heads?  
- Each head learns to attend to different subspaces of the input.  
- One head might focus on syntax (e.g., verb-noun relations), another on semantics (e.g., sentiment).

### 9.2 Implementation Details  

1. **Linear Projections**:  
   \[ Q_h = XW_h^Q,\quad K_h = XW_h^K,\quad V_h = XW_h^V \]  
   for each head \( h \in [1, H] \).

2. **Independent Attention**:  
   \[ \text{head}_h = \text{Attention}(Q_h, K_h, V_h) \]

3. **Concatenate & Project**:  
   \[ \text{MultiHead}(X) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, \dots, \text{head}_H)\,W^O \]

```text
Input X ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ [Linear Q,K,V for head1] ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Attention ‚îÄ‚îê
            ‚Ä¶                                     ‚îú‚ñ∫ Concat ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Linear ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Output
         [Linear Q,K,V for headH] ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ Attention ‚îÄ‚îò
```

## 10. Self-Attention vs. Cross-Attention  

|                    | Self-Attention                           | Cross-Attention                              |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Inputs to Q, K, V  | Same sequence                            | Q from decoder, K/V from encoder output      |
| Use Case           | Encoding relationships within a sequence | Aligning decoder output to encoder context   |
| Transformer Block  | Encoder layers primarily                 | Decoder layers between encoder and decoder   |

- **Self-Attention**: Tokens attend to each other within the same sequence.  
- **Cross-Attention**: Decoder queries encoder outputs to integrate source information.

---

## 11. Visualizing Attention Weights  

Attention weights \(\alpha_{ij}\) reveal which input tokens matter most for each output token.

### Example:  
Input sentence:  
> ‚ÄúThe cat sat on the mat because it was tired.‚Äù  
Output focus for tile ‚Äúit‚Äù:  

| Token     | The  | cat  | sat  | on  | the  | mat  | because | it   | was  | tired |
|-----------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|---------|------|------|-------|
| Attention | 0.01 | 0.02 | 0.03 |0.01 | 0.02 | 0.03 |  0.05   |0.70  |0.03  |0.11   |

> **Insight:** The model links ‚Äúit‚Äù strongly to ‚Äúcat‚Äù (0.70 probability).

#### ASCII Heatmap Example  
```
       The   cat   sat   on   the   mat  because   it   was  tired
Output "it":
      [   1    2    3    1     2     3      5     70    3    11 ]
```

## 12. Variants of Attention  

| Variant                 | Description                                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Additive (Bahdanau)     | Uses feed-forward network on [Q, K] before scoring      |
| Dot-Product             | Efficient using matrix multiplies (as in Transformers)  |
| Relative Positional     | Learns position relationships instead of fixed encoding |
| Sparse Attention        | Limits attention to local windows for efficiency       |

---

## 13. Computational Considerations  

### 13.1 Time Complexity  
- **Self-Attention**: \(O(n^2 \cdot d)\) for sequence length n and dimension d.  
- Quadratic in n‚Äîchallenging for very long sequences.

### 13.2 Memory Footprint  
- Storing full attention matrices \((n \times n)\) can exhaust GPU memory.  

### 13.3 Efficiency Tricks  
- **Sparse Attention**: Attend only locally or via sampling.  
- **Linformer / Performer**: Approximate attention with linear complexity.  

---

## 14. Key Takeaways for Attention  

- Attention enables models to directly link any input and output positions, capturing long-range dependencies.  
- Scaled dot-product attention is efficient, but multi-head further enriches representation.  
- Self-attention powers encoders, cross-attention aligns encoder and decoder.  
- Visualization of attention weights offers interpretability into ‚Äúwhy‚Äù a model makes its predictions.  

## 15. Pretrained Language Models: A Primer

### 16.2 Training Objective  
1. **Masked Language Modeling (MLM):**  
   - Randomly mask 15% of tokens.  
   - Predict original token from context.

2. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):**

MLM Target: mat
NSP Target: IsNext
```

### 16.3 Fine-Tuning BERT  
- **Task-specific Head:** Add classification or regression layers atop BERT.  
- **Process:**  
  1. Initialize with pretrained weights  
  2. Train on labeled dataset (e.g., sentiment, NER)  
  3. Use small learning rate (2e-5 ‚Äì 5e-5)  

**Example: Sentiment Analysis**  
```python
from transformers import BertForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
# prepare dataset‚Ä¶
args = TrainingArguments(output_dir='out', num_train_epochs=3, learning_rate=3e-5)
trainer = Trainer(model=model, args=args, train_dataset=train_ds, eval_dataset=eval_ds)
trainer.train()
```

```text
Prompt:
Q: If two trains leave A and B‚Ä¶ 
A: Let's think step by step‚Ä¶ 
```

## 18. Large Language Models (LLMs): Scaling Laws & Capabilities  

### 18.1 Scaling Laws  
- **Observation:** Performance improves predictably with more parameters, data, and compute.  
- **Tradeoff:** Diminishing returns vs. cost.  

| Scale Factor      | Effect                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Model Size        | Better context understanding           |
| Training Data     | Broader world knowledge                |
| Compute Budget    | Enables larger batches, longer context |

### 18.2 Zero-/Few-Shot Learning  
- **Zero-Shot:** Model performs tasks it hasn‚Äôt explicitly trained on.  
- **Few-Shot:** Model sees a small number of examples in prompt and adapts.

### 18.3 In-Context Learning  
- Learning from prompt context alone‚Äîno weight updates.  
- **Use Case:** Quick prototyping of new tasks.
