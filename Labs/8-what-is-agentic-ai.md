# ü§ñ What Is Agentic AI?  
## 1. Introduction  

Artificial Intelligence has advanced from simple rule-based decision trees to sophisticated deep-learning models. But most AI today still performs **one-shot inference**: you give it input, it returns output.  

Agentic AI takes a **giant leap** beyond. Agents have:

- **Autonomy**: decide when and how to act  
- **Memory**: remember past interactions or data  
- **Reasoning**: deliberate on goals and next steps  
- **Planning**: decompose objectives into actionable tasks  
- **Actions**: call APIs, execute code, write documents  

In this document, we‚Äôll unpack exactly what makes AI agentic, explore deep-dive components, and see multiple real-world implementations across industries.

## 2. Traditional AI vs. Agentic AI  

### 2.1. Traditional AI: One-Shot Inference  

- **Workflow**: Input ‚Üí Model ‚Üí Output  
- **Stateless** between calls  
- **Examples**:  
  - Image classifier labeling cats vs. dogs  
  - Sentiment model returning ‚Äúpositive‚Äù or ‚Äúnegative‚Äù  
  - Rule-based chatbots answering FAQs  

These systems excel at **narrow**, well-defined tasks but cannot pursue multi-step goals.

### 2.2. Agentic AI: Continuous Sense‚ÄìPlan‚ÄìAct  

- **Workflow Loop**:  
  1. **Sense** environment or user query  
  2. **Reason** about objectives  
  3. **Plan** series of actions  
  4. **Act** by calling tools/APIs or writing files  
  5. **Observe** results, update memory  
  6. **Repeat** until goal is met  

- **Examples**:  
  - **AutoGPT** autonomously researches and writes reports  
  - **GitHub Copilot** suggests code as you type, adapts to your edits  
  - **Home Assistant Agents** monitor sensors and adjust thermostats  

### 2.3. Key Differences Side by Side  

| Aspect              | Traditional AI              | Agentic AI                                |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Invocation          | Human calls model           | Agent self-initiates when needed          |
| Statefulness        | None                        | Maintains context and memory              |
| Granularity         | One-task, one inference     | Multi-step, task pipelines                |
| Adaptivity          | Fixed weights, no planning  | Dynamic plans, adapts based on feedback   |
| Integration         | Model-only                  | Models + code + APIs + databases          |

## 3. Core Components of an AI Agent  

Every agent‚Äîwhether a simple chatbot or a complex autonomous researcher‚Äîshares these modules:

### 3.1. Memory  

- **Short-Term Memory**  
  - Conversation history, recent API results  
  - Stored in lists or buffers  

- **Long-Term Memory**  
  - Persisted facts, embeddings in vector stores  
  - Used for retrieval and context over long sessions  

> **Real-Life Example:**  
> GitHub Copilot retains file context and variable names across dozens of lines, so suggestions stay relevant.

### 3.2. Perception / Observation  

- Receives raw inputs: user text, API JSON, sensor data  
- **Normalizes** data into structured formats  
- **Examples:**  
  - Parsing Slack messages into commands  
  - Converting IoT sensor readings into time-series  

### 3.3. Reasoning  

- Decides which goals to pursue or subtasks to execute  
- Techniques:  
  - **Chain-of-Thought** prompting in LLMs  
  - **Symbolic logic** or rule engines for deterministic steps  
  - **Reinforcement learning** to refine policies  

> **Case Study:**  
> An agent reasoning through a troubleshooting flowchart for network diagnostics: ‚ÄúIf ping fails, test DNS; else test HTTP‚Ä¶‚Äù

### 3.4. Planning  

- Decomposes high-level goals into ordered steps  
- **Task Graphs** or **pipelines** represent dependencies  
- **Example Plan:**  
  1. Scrape website for product info  
  2. Summarize key features  
  3. Generate marketing email  
  4. Send via Mail API  

### 3.5. Action / Execution  

- Invokes external tools: REST APIs, database queries  
- Runs code: shell commands, Python functions  
- Writes outputs: documents, emails, database records  

> **Example Code Snippet:**  
> ```python
> import requests
> def send_email(recipient, subject, body):
>     return requests.post("https://api.mail.com/send", json={
>         "to": recipient, "subject": subject, "body": body
>     })
> ```

### 3.6. Feedback & Learning Loop  

- Observes results of actions  
- Logs success/failure in memory  
- Refines next planning cycle based on outcomes  

> **Analogy:**  
> Like a human iterating on a cooking recipe: taste ‚Üí adjust spices ‚Üí cook again.

## 4. Deep Dive: Memory Architectures  

### 4.1. Short-Term vs. Long-Term Memory  

| Memory Type    | Volatility                   | Storage Medium       | Use Case                       |
|----------------|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Short-Term     | Clears every session/minutes | In-RAM lists/buffers | Immediate context, turn taking |
| Long-Term      | Persists across sessions     | Databases, vector DB | Knowledge retention, retrieval |

### 4.2. Vector Stores & Retrieval  

- Convert text/chunks into embeddings  
- Store in FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate  
- **Retrieval** via nearest-neighbor search  

> **Real-Life Example:**  
> A legal-tech agent stores all past case summaries as vectors. When asked about ‚Äúcontract breach,‚Äù it retrieves the top 5 similar cases instantly.

### 4.3. Example: Chat History in Copilot  

GitHub Copilot‚Äôs UI retains the last 100 tokens of code and comments, effectively using short-term memory to predict the next suggestions.

## 5. Deep Dive: Reasoning & Planning  

### 5.1. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning  

- LLMs generate intermediate reasoning steps  
- Encourages transparent decision paths  

```text
Q: If I have 3 apples and eat 1, how many left?
A: Let's think step by step:
   1. Start with 3 apples.
   2. Eat 1 apple.
   3. 3 - 1 = 2 apples remaining.
   Answer: 2.
```

### 5.2. Task Decomposition  

- Break down complex goals into subtasks  
- Example: ‚ÄúOrganize a webinar‚Äù  
  1. Create agenda  
  2. Invite speakers  
  3. Design slide deck  
  4. Send invites  
  5. Host session  

### 5.3. Example: AutoGPT Recursive Planning  

AutoGPT often uses its own outputs to refine next goals. Given ‚ÄúWrite a research report,‚Äù it will plan abstract ‚Üí introduction ‚Üí method ‚Üí conclusion, and loop over each section.

---

## 6. Deep Dive: Perception & Sensors  

### 6.1. Textual Inputs  

- Chatbots reading Slack, email, or web forms  
- Use tokenizers to convert text ‚Üí token IDs  

### 6.2. API & Tool Observations  

- HTTP response JSON parsed into dicts  
- Structured data fed into decision modules  

### 6.3. Sensor Data (IoT Agents)  

- Temperature, motion, humidity sensors  
- Agents trigger HVAC adjustments or security alerts  

> **Real-Life Example:**  
> A smart greenhouse agent reads soil moisture sensors and actuates irrigation pumps automatically.

## 7. Deep Dive: Execution & Tool Use  

### 7.1. Calling REST APIs  

```python
import requests

def search_wikipedia(query):
    resp = requests.get("https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/" + query)
    return resp.json().get("extract")
```

### 7.2. Running Code Snippets  

- Agents can spawn subprocesses  
- Example: transcode video via FFmpeg  

```python
import subprocess

def transcode_mp4_to_webm(src, dest):
    subprocess.run(["ffmpeg", "-i", src, "-c:v", "libvpx", dest])
```

### 7.3. Example: LangChain Tool Integration  

```python
from langchain import OpenAI, Tool, initialize_agent

def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    # call external search API‚Ä¶
    return "Search results..."

search_tool = Tool(name="search", func=web_search, description="Web search")

agent = initialize_agent([search_tool], OpenAI(temperature=0), agent="zero-shot-react-description")
agent.run("Find the capital of France")
```

1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install langchain openai requests
   ```  
2. Export OpenAI API key:

def wiki_summary(topic: str) -> str:
    url = f"https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/summary/{topic}"
    data = requests.get(url).json()
    return data.get("extract", "No summary available.")

wiki_tool = Tool(

    func=wiki_summary,
    description="Get a Wikipedia summary for a given topic"
)
```

# Run the agent
output = agent.run("Summarize the history of artificial intelligence.")
print(output)
```

### 10.5. Execution & Feedback Loop
