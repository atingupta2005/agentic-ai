# 📘 Introduction to Deep Learning  
## 🌟 Section 1: What Is Deep Learning?

Deep Learning is a subset of **Machine Learning** where models automatically learn patterns from **large data sets** using **neural networks**. These neural networks mimic how the human brain processes information.

### 🧠 Analogy:
Imagine your brain as a big web of neurons. Each neuron passes a signal to another. Deep learning builds artificial versions of these neurons to process information in layers.

## 📚 Section 2: Understanding Neural Networks

### 🧩 What is a Neural Network?

A neural network is a collection of layers that take input data, perform computations, and output predictions.

**Basic structure:**
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process the data using mathematical transformations
- **Output Layer**: Produces results (e.g., Yes/No, a digit 0–9, a category)

## 🧱 Section 3: The Perceptron – Building Block of Neural Networks

### What is a Perceptron?
A perceptron is the simplest type of neural unit. It takes inputs, multiplies each by a **weight**, adds a **bias**, and applies an **activation function**.

---

### 💡 Example:

Let's say a perceptron takes two inputs: Hours Studied (x₁) and Sleep Quality (x₂) to predict Exam Score.

```python
def simple_perceptron(x1, x2):
    w1, w2, b = 0.6, 0.4, 1
    output = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + b
    return output
```

## 🎚️ Section 4: Activation Functions

Activation functions determine whether a neuron "fires" or not. They introduce **non-linearity**, allowing networks to learn complex patterns.

| Function                         | Formula                                                 | Use Case                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Sigmoid**                      | $\displaystyle \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$                    | Probabilities, binary output |
| **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)** | $\max(0, x)$                                            | Most modern networks         |
| **Tanh**                         | $\tanh(x)$                                              | Classification, regression   |
| **Softmax**                      | $\displaystyle \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}}$ (vector) | Multi-class classification   |

## 🧠 Section 5: Designing a Neural Network – Step-by-Step

Let’s design a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

### 🔢 Steps:
1. **Import Data** (Images of digits)
2. **Normalize Data**
3. **Create Network**: Input layer → Hidden layers → Output layer
4. **Choose Activation Functions**
5. **Define Loss Function**
6. **Train the Model**

### 🧪 Hands-on Code (Keras Example):

```python
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load Data
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0
y_train = to_categorical(y_train)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test)

# Build Model
model = Sequential([
    Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Predict on test set
predictions = model.predict(x_test)

# Convert predictions from probabilities to class labels
predicted_classes = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)

# Print first 10 predictions vs actual labels
print("Predicted classes:", predicted_classes[:10])
print("Actual classes:   ", y_test[:10])
```

## 🧮 Section 6: Loss Functions – Measuring Mistakes

Loss functions measure how far off the model’s prediction is from the actual value. It's like a "report card" for the model.

### Common Loss Functions:

| Type                         | Function                                                  | When to Use                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** | $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$            | Regression problems                      |
| **Binary Crossentropy**      | $-y \log(\hat{y}) - (1 - y) \log(1 - \hat{y})$            | Binary classification                    |
| **Categorical Crossentropy** | $-\sum_{c=1}^C y_c \log(\hat{y}_c)$ (extension of binary) | Multi-class classification               |
| **Hinge Loss**               | $\max(0, 1 - y \cdot \hat{y})$                            | Margin-based classification (e.g., SVMs) |

## 🛠️ Section 7: Optimization Techniques

Optimization adjusts weights and biases to minimize loss. The goal is to improve predictions over time.

### Popular Algorithms:

| Optimizer      | Feature                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Gradient Descent | Moves weights in direction of negative gradient |
| Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) | Faster, uses small data batches |
| Adam            | Adaptive learning rates, most used       |
| RMSprop         | Deals well with noisy data               |

---

### 🔄 Analogy:
Imagine you're hiking downhill blindfolded. You feel the slope and take small steps. That’s gradient descent—gradually adjusting in the best direction.

---

### 🔍 Update Rule (Gradient Descent):


$$
w = w - \alpha \times \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
$$

Where:

* $\alpha$ = learning rate
* $\frac{\partial L}{\partial w}$ = derivative of the loss $L$ with respect to weight $w$

### 🖼️ Example:
Image classification (cats vs. dogs), facial recognition

---
