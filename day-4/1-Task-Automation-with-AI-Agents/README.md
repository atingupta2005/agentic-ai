# ⚙️ Task Automation with AI Agents  
_A detailed guide on how autonomous AI agents automate tasks like data extraction, email writing, and decision-making, with in-depth examples in finance report automation and legal document summarization._

## 1. Overview of Task Automation  

Task automation with AI agents refers to end-to-end workflows where an agent:  
- **Ingests data** from diverse sources (databases, APIs, documents)  
- **Processes** and interprets it (extraction, classification, summarization)  
- **Acts** by generating outputs (reports, emails, decisions)  
- **Loops** by scheduling or waiting for triggers

By chaining LLM reasoning with code or tool calls, agents move beyond one-off predictions to complete business tasks autonomously.

## 2. How AI Agents Automate Workflows  

### 2.1. Sense–Plan–Act Pipeline  
1. **Sense**: Collect raw inputs (SQL tables, documents, user prompts).  
2. **Plan**: Use an LLM or rule engine to decide next steps.  
3. **Act**: Execute code — run queries, call APIs, compose text.  
4. **Observe**: Check outcomes, log results, handle exceptions.  

```text
[SENSE: fetch sales data] → [PLAN: aggregate by region] → [ACT: run SQL & LLM summarize] → [OBSERVE: verify correctness]
```

### 2.2. Triggering and Scheduling  
- **Time-based triggers**: Cron jobs, cloud schedulers  
- **Event-based triggers**: File arrival, webhook calls, message queue events  
- Agents can also **chain** tasks: one agent’s output triggers the next.

### 2.3. Error Handling & Logging  
- Wrap each action in `try/except` blocks  
- Log successes and failures with timestamps  
- On failure: retry, fallback to human review, or escalate  

```python
try:
    report = agent.run("Generate monthly P&L report")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Report generation failed: {e}")
    notify_admin(e)
```

## 3. Data Extraction Use Cases  

AI agents extract structured data from varied sources:

### 3.1. Extracting Tabular Data from Databases  
- Use ORM or direct SQL queries  
- Combine LLMs to **translate** natural-language queries into SQL  

```python
from langchain.chains import SQLDatabaseChain
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:pass@host/db")
db_chain = SQLDatabaseChain(llm=llm, database=engine)

# Agent can interpret: “Total sales last quarter by region”
answer = db_chain.run("Total sales last quarter by region")
print(answer)
```

### 3.2. Scraping and Parsing Web Pages  
- Use `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` or headless browsers  
- Agents decide which sites to crawl and which fields to extract  

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_products(url):
    r = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(r.text, "html.parser")
    items = []
    for card in soup.select(".product-card"):
        name = card.select_one(".title").text
        price = card.select_one(".price").text
        items.append({"name": name, "price": price})
    return items
```

### 3.3. Example: Finance Report Automation  
1. **Sense**: Query sales and expense tables  
2. **Plan**: Decide KPIs (revenue, COGS, margin)  
3. **Act**:  
   - Run SQL aggregates  
   - Generate narrative with LLM  
4. **Observe**: Validate totals, format PDF  

---

## 4. Email Composition and Dispatch  

### 4.1. Personalization with LLMs  
- Agents use templates and LLMs to tailor tone, incorporate recipient details  

```python
template = """
Hello {name},

Here is your weekly summary:
{summary}

Best,
AI Assistant
"""

message = template.format(name=client_name, summary=weekly_summary)
```

Or generate free-form:

```python
email_body = llm(f"Write a professional email to {client_name} summarizing this data: {weekly_summary}")
```

### 4.2. Integrating with Email APIs  
- **SMTP** for on-premise  
- **SendGrid**, **Mailgun**, **AWS SES** for cloud delivery  

```python
import sendgrid
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail

sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key=SG_KEY)
email = Mail(from_email="bot@example.com",
             to_emails=client_email,
             subject="Your Weekly Report",
             html_content=email_body)
sg.send(email)
```

### 4.3. Example: Automated Weekly Summary Emails  
- Schedule agent to run every Monday at 8 AM  
- Fetch past week’s metrics, generate narrative, and dispatch  
- Log send status and bounce/error reports

## 5. Automated Decision-Making  

### 5.1. Rule-Based vs. LLM-Assisted Decisions  
- **Rule-Based**: Hard-coded IF-THEN logic for approvals  
- **LLM-Assisted**: Use LLM to weigh factors, explain rationale  

```python
# Rule-based
if credit_score > 700 and income > 50000:
    decision = "approve"
else:
    decision = "deny"

# LLM-assisted
prompt = f"Assess credit loan application: score={score}, income={income}, existing_debt={debt}"
decision = llm(prompt)
```

### 5.2. Example: Credit Approval Agent  
1. **Sense**: Pull applicant data from CRM  
2. **Plan**: If rule applies, auto-approve; else ask LLM  
3. **Act**: Update CRM with decision, notify applicant  
4. **Observe**: Log decision and explanation

## 6. Case Study: Finance Report Automation  

### 6.1. Business Requirements  
- Monthly P&L, balance sheet, cash flow highlights  
- Narrative summary of variances vs. budget  

### 6.2. Data Ingestion and Aggregation  
```python
sales = db_chain.run("SELECT region, SUM(amount) FROM sales WHERE date >= '2023-01-01' GROUP BY region;")
expenses = db_chain.run("SELECT category, SUM(amount) FROM expenses WHERE date >= '2023-01-01' GROUP BY category;")
```

### 6.3. Narrative Generation with LLMs  
```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a concise executive summary:
Sales by region: {sales}
Expenses by category: {expenses}
"""
summary = llm(prompt)
```

### 6.4. Schedule and Delivery  
- Use `cron` or cloud scheduler to invoke agent script  
- Email PDF via SendGrid or upload to SharePoint  

---

## 7. Case Study: Legal Document Summarization  

### 7.1. Handling Long Documents  
- Large contracts (50+ pages) exceed LLM context windows  
- **Chunk** text into sections of ~1,000 tokens  

### 7.2. Chunking and Embedding Retrieval  
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, overlap=200)
chunks = splitter.split_text(large_document)
```

### 7.3. Summarization Pipelines  
- Summarize each chunk, then combine  

```python
summaries = [llm(f"Summarize this legal clause: {c}") for c in chunks]
final_summary = llm("Combine these summaries into one concise summary:\n" + "\n".join(summaries))
```

### 7.4. Compliance and Accuracy Checks  
- Agents call a secondary LLM or rules to verify no critical terms omitted  
- Flag high-risk clauses for lawyer review

## 8. Putting It All Together: Sample Agent Architecture  

```text
┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐       ┌───────────┐
│ Scheduler ├──────►│   Agent   ├──────►│  Tools    ├──────►│  Services │
└───────────┘       └───────────┘       └───────────┘       └───────────┘
      ▲                 │                      │                   │
      │                 ▼                      ▼                   ▼
 Time-Based/ Event  [Sense]               [Act: DB, API]       [Email, PDF]
```

- **Scheduler** triggers agent  
- **Agent** senses data, plans tasks  
- **Tools** perform queries, scraping, summarization  
- **Services** deliver outputs (email, storage)

## 9. Hands-On Lab: Build Your Own Report-Writing Agent  

1. **Setup**:  
   ```bash
   pip install langchain openai sqlalchemy sendgrid
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=… SG_API_KEY=… DATABASE_URL=…
   ```

2. **Implement**:  
   - SQLDatabaseChain to fetch metrics  
   - LLM to generate narrative  
   - SendGrid to email report  

3. **Test**: Run locally, inspect logs  
4. **Schedule**: Deploy on cloud with a scheduler  

---

## 10. Best Practices and Considerations  

- **Idempotency**: Design agents so repeated runs don’t duplicate outputs  
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Notify on failures or exceptions  
- **Security**: Store API keys securely (vaults, env vars)  
- **Explainability**: Log LLM prompts, responses, and decisions for audit  
- **Data Privacy**: Mask or anonymize sensitive data when summarizing
