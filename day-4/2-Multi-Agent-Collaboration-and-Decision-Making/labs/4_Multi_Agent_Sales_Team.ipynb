    "\n",
    "In this advanced lab, we will use the OpenAI Agents SDK to construct a sophisticated, multi-agent system that automates the process of generating and sending cold sales outreach emails. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will demonstrate several key agentic design patterns:\n",
    "1.  **Agent Specialization**: Creating multiple agents, each with a unique persona and task.\n",
    "2.  **Parallel Execution**: Running multiple agents simultaneously to generate diverse outputs.\n",
    "3.  **Evaluator Agent**: Using one agent to review and select the best output from others.\n",
    "4.  **Tools as Functions**: Converting a regular Python function into a tool that an agent can use.\n",
    "5.  **Agents as Tools**: Converting an entire agent into a tool for another agent to use.\n",
    "6.  **Handoffs**: Delegating a task from a manager agent to a subordinate agent to complete a workflow."

    "2.  **Create an API Key**: In the SendGrid dashboard, navigate to `Settings` > `API Keys` and click `Create API Key`. Give it a name and create the key.\n",

    "    ```\n",
