## 1. Introduction  

Modern enterprises in finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity face complex, high-stakes decisions under tight time constraints. AI agents‚Äîautonomous software entities that sense, reason, plan, and act‚Äîare increasingly deployed to:  
- Automate data‚Äêdriven analyses  
- Scale decision pipelines  
- Reduce human workload and error  
- Respond in real time to emerging threats  

In this document, we explore how AI agents are applied in three critical domains: finance, health, and cyber defense.

2. **Plan:** Use statistical or ML models to calculate risk scores per account.  
3. **Act:** Flag high-risk accounts, recommend credit limits or margin calls.  
4. **Observe:** Monitor outcome of interventions (loan performance, margin calls).

**Techniques & Models:**  
- Logistic regression, XGBoost for credit scoring  
- Monte Carlo simulations for portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR)

## 3. AI Agents in Healthcare  

AI agents in healthcare assist clinicians by triaging patients, interpreting medical images, and accelerating drug discovery pipelines.

### 3.1 Medical Diagnosis

**Agent Workflow:**  
1. **Sense:** Ingest imaging scans or structured EHR data.  
2. **Plan:** Apply CNNs or transformer models to detect signs of pathology.  
3. **Act:** Generate diagnosis probabilities; recommend further tests.  
4. **Observe:** Track patient outcomes; refine diagnostic thresholds.

**Techniques & Models:**  
- U-Net, ResNet for image segmentation and classification  
- Transformer-based patient triage from clinical notes  
- Multi-modal fusion combining images and labs  

### 3.2 Drug Discovery  

**Goal:** Identify novel therapeutic molecules and optimize lead compounds.  

**Agent Workflow:**  
1. **Sense:** Access virtual libraries of chemical structures.  
2. **Plan:** Use generative models (GANs, VAE) to propose new compounds.  
3. **Act:** Simulate interactions (molecular docking via AutoDock).  
4. **Observe:** Rank candidates by predicted binding affinity; suggest synthesis.

**Techniques & Models:**  
- Graph neural networks for molecule representation (DGL, PyTorch Geometric)  
- Reinforcement learning for de novo molecule generation  
- Active learning loops with wet-lab feedback

## 4. AI Agents in Cybersecurity  

AI agents bolster network defenses by monitoring logs, detecting intrusions, and automating incident response in real time.

### 4.1 Real-Time Monitoring  

**Goal:** Continuously watch network traffic, system logs, and user behaviors.  

**Agent Workflow:**  
1. **Sense:** Stream logs from SIEM (Splunk, ELK), network taps.  
2. **Plan:** Apply time-series anomaly detectors and behavioral analytics.  
3. **Act:** Generate alerts, isolate compromised hosts, or trigger sandbox analysis.
